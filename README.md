# **Unveil Genius: AI Science Museum with Historical Figures - Frontend**

**Unveil Genius** is an AI-powered science museum featuring historical figures, a Richard Feynman chatbot, and debates between Newton and Einstein, designed to engage middle and high school students. The project started as part of the **CS7180 CS/AI in Education** course at Northeastern University and was later extended into a fully functional website through a summer RAship and the **CS7980 Research Capstone** course. This repository contains the frontend of the application, built with React and JavaScript, and is hosted on Netlify.
